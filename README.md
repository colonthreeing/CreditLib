# CreditLib

Balatro API library for easy implementation of a Credits badge in your balatro mods.

Requires SMODS.

To use it, simply add this to your SMODS definitions:

```
	credits = {
		art = { "" },
		code = { "" },
		idea = { "" }
	}
```

And replace the values with your own.

This is based on the work in the Balatro Multiplayer mod, which is in itself based on Cryptid. If either party wants me to remove the code from here then I will, and will try to remake it myself.
